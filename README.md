# Password Protection for WordPress

Are you creating a private website only available to users who have WordPress credentials?

Download this plugin to password protect your ENTIRE WordPress website so only users you create have the ability to view your website.

Make sure to uncheck the option "Anyone can register" so that no one (yes, I'm talking about you bots!) can register :)
